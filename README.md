# SmartCipherFlow: Trustless Crypto Asset Rebalancing Framework

SmartCipherFlow is a decentralized autonomous bot trading framework designed to facilitate trustless crypto asset rebalancing. It leverages smart contract oracles and verifiable compute to ensure secure and transparent execution of trading strategies, eliminating the need for centralized intermediaries. The framework provides a robust and auditable platform for automated portfolio management in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space.

The core purpose of SmartCipherFlow is to democratize access to sophisticated algorithmic trading strategies. Traditional automated trading systems often require significant technical expertise and rely on centralized exchanges, introducing counterparty risk. SmartCipherFlow addresses these challenges by utilizing smart contracts for trade execution, decentralized oracles for price feeds, and verifiable compute for strategy execution, creating a system where all participants can verify the integrity of the trading process. This enhances transparency, reduces the risk of manipulation, and fosters trust among users. The framework allows users to define custom rebalancing strategies based on various market indicators, risk parameters, and portfolio composition goals.

SmartCipherFlow offers a modular architecture, allowing developers to easily integrate new data sources, trading strategies, and execution venues. The framework's reliance on verifiable compute ensures that strategy execution is tamper-proof and auditable. Moreover, the framework is designed to be gas-efficient, minimizing transaction costs on the blockchain. By leveraging decentralized oracles, SmartCipherFlow obtains real-time and accurate price data from multiple sources, mitigating the risks associated with relying on a single price feed. The bot is designed to work across multiple chains with EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) compatibility.

Key Features:

*   **Smart Contract Execution:** Trading logic is encoded in smart contracts, guaranteeing automated and trustless execution of trades based on predefined conditions. Smart contracts implement the trade logic generated by the rebalancing algorithm.
*   **Decentralized Oracle Integration:** Utilizes Chainlink, Tellor, or similar decentralized oracle networks to obtain reliable and tamper-proof price feeds for various crypto assets. Smart contracts interact directly with oracle contracts to fetch price data. The oracle contracts are configured through environment variables, allowing users to select their preferred oracle provider and data feed.
*   **Verifiable Compute:** Implements verifiable compute using platforms like Truebit or Cartesi, enabling off-chain execution of complex trading strategies while ensuring on-chain verification of the results. This significantly reduces gas costs and allows for more sophisticated trading algorithms. The computation results are submitted to the smart contract for validation before trade execution.
*   **Customizable Rebalancing Strategies:** Allows users to define custom rebalancing strategies based on factors such as target asset allocation, risk tolerance, and market indicators. The framework includes a strategy definition language (SDL) allowing users to define their own triggers.
*   **Risk Management Modules:** Incorporates risk management modules, including stop-loss orders, take-profit targets, and maximum position sizes, to protect user funds and manage portfolio volatility.
*   **Modular Architecture:** Designed with a modular architecture that allows for easy integration of new data sources, trading strategies, and execution venues. Modules are implemented as independent Python classes and can be easily plugged into the core framework.
*   **Cross-Chain Compatibility:** Designed to be compatible with multiple EVM-compatible blockchains, enabling rebalancing across different DeFi ecosystems. The bot leverages web3.py to interact with different blockchain networks.

Technology Stack:

*   **Python:** The primary programming language for the core trading logic and bot implementation.
*   **Web3.py:** A Python library for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain. Used for deploying and interacting with smart contracts, and retrieving blockchain data.
*   **Solidity:** The programming language used for writing smart contracts deployed on the Ethereum blockchain.
*   **Chainlink/Tellor:** Decentralized oracle networks providing reliable and tamper-proof price feeds.
*   **Truebit/Cartesi:** Verifiable compute platforms for off-chain computation and on-chain verification.
*   **Ganache/Hardhat:** Local Ethereum development environments for testing and debugging smart contracts.

Installation:

1.  Clone the repository:
    git clone https://github.com/jjfhwang/SmartCipherFlow.git
    cd SmartCipherFlow

2.  Install Python 3.8 or higher.

3.  Create a virtual environment:
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate (or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows)

4.  Install dependencies:
    pip install -r requirements.txt

5.  Install Ganache or Hardhat for local blockchain development. Follow instructions on their respective websites for setup.

Configuration:

1.  Create a `.env` file in the root directory.

2.  Define the following environment variables:

    *   `WEB3_PROVIDER_URI`: The URI of your Ethereum node (e.g., Infura, Alchemy, or a local Ganache/Hardhat node). Example: `http://127.0.0.1:8545`
    *   `PRIVATE_KEY`: The private key of the Ethereum account that will be used to execute trades. Ensure this account has sufficient funds.
    *   `SMART_CONTRACT_ADDRESS`: The address of the deployed smart contract.
    *   `ORACLE_PROVIDER`: The name of the oracle provider (e.g., "Chainlink", "Tellor").
    *   `ORACLE_ADDRESS_BTC_USD`: The address of the oracle contract for BTC/USD price feed.
    *   `ORACLE_ADDRESS_ETH_USD`: The address of the oracle contract for ETH/USD price feed.
    *   `VERIFIABLE_COMPUTE_PLATFORM`: The verifiable compute platform used (e.g., "Truebit", "Cartesi").
    *   `REBALANCING_STRATEGY_FILE`: Path to your rebalancing strategy configuration file.
    *   `GAS_PRICE`: Gas price in gwei to use for transactions.

    Example `.env` file:

    WEB3_PROVIDER_URI=http://127.0.0.1:8545
    PRIVATE_KEY=0x...
    SMART_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x...
    ORACLE_PROVIDER=Chainlink
    ORACLE_ADDRESS_BTC_USD=0x...
    ORACLE_ADDRESS_ETH_USD=0x...
    VERIFIABLE_COMPUTE_PLATFORM=Truebit
    REBALANCING_STRATEGY_FILE=strategies/default_strategy.json
    GAS_PRICE=20

Usage:

1.  Ensure that your smart contract is deployed to the specified blockchain and that the `SMART_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` is correctly configured in the `.env` file.

2.  Define your rebalancing strategy in a JSON file. Example:

    {
    "target_allocation": {
    "BTC": 0.6,
    "ETH": 0.4
    },
    "rebalancing_threshold": 0.05,
    "risk_parameters": {
    "stop_loss": 0.1,
    "take_profit": 0.2
    }
    }

3.  Run the SmartCipherFlow bot:

    python main.py

    This will start the bot, which will periodically check the current portfolio allocation, compare it to the target allocation defined in the strategy file, and execute trades to rebalance the portfolio if necessary.

4.  For detailed API documentation, refer to the `docs/api.md` file (not yet present in initial release, but planned for future iterations).
